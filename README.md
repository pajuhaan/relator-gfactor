# Relator g-factor — Analytic & Reproducible

Closed-form, gauge-invariant, UV-finite computation of the lepton magnetic factor \(g\) from the Relator postulate \(R\omega=c\).  
Includes high-precision scripts for the S1–S4 vector backreaction, the scalar mass channel \(\chi\) (running \(\alpha\)), the TT population map, and the closed OUT subtraction — all without QED loops or fit parameters.

## Quick results (baseline S3 + mass-hierarchy enhancement)
